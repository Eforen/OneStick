# OneStick (Tree Felling Fix)

Currently just fixes what appears to be a bug in the vanilla axe code. 

When felling a tree the branchy leaves rarely ever drop sticks.

The game code seems to indicate that they should drop sticks around 80% of the time when felling the tree.

I started with this number as a static number but that did not feel right too many sticks and no ramp when using better axes.

# Future Plans

## Sticky sticky sticks

I plan to add several other features that will be likely off by default.

Some of my ideas are as follows:
- [ ] Dowls/Wooden Rods that can be used in place of sticks but also can be used by other mods for more advanced things that need more acurate long sticky things
- [ ] Allow crude wooden rods to be made by using a saw on the left or right of a plank in the crafting grid to split it down the center.
- [ ] Considering allowing an axe to do the above.
- [ ] Make some mechinery that allows the splitting of planks into logs.
- [ ] Allowing the mechinery to split planks into 3 Wooden Rods

I am totally open to any other ideas please suggest them to me.

You can suggest them to me on discord or anywhere else you find me.
